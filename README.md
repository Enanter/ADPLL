Phase locked loops are a control system that generates an output signal whose phase is related to the input signal. Historically PLL’s were analog components. The topology used a VCO, phase detector and feedback loop. By increasing and decreasing the voltage the system could modulate the clocks to obtain the desired output. 
A digital alternating solves these problems by removing the large capacitors and Inductors and having a much broader range of operation. Furthermore, ADPLLs can be integrated on a single integrated circuit making them more compatible with modern electronic devices.
Texas Instruments has tasked us with designing, simulating and emulating a digital PLL. This specification document is designed for those of a technical background with an emphasis on electrical and computer engineering. It describes the project requirements, system architecture, system design, project bill of materials, ethical considerations and references. The document's primary goal is to facilitate others to understand and implement the process we took in designing and testing an ADPLL.  
Our ADPLL design has feed forward design, which is unique design for a PLL. It uses one-shot to trigger the ring oscillator.  However, due to physical limitaion(propagation delay), the phase is not always matching.
Our sponsor said "This indicates the team has successfully implemented a fully digital frequency multiplication function that is traditionally performed using an Analog PLL in about 12% of the area, or an 86% savings in silicon real estate." But also the limitaion is "A pseudo-phase lock is achieved by periodically resetting the ring oscillator used in the design to re-synchronize it to the input clock. While never truly locked as a function of the architecture, their approach allows a reasonable approximation with an expected phase lag of roughly 20 ps – 40 ps in a 65 nm CMOS process."
